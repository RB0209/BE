Be Eternal — Vite + React + Tailwind + Framer Motion
===================================================

What you get
------------
- A complete starter site built with Vite, React (18), TailwindCSS and Framer Motion.
- Pages: Home, About, Contact, SEO (with subpages), Content (with subpages), Social Media, Gifts, Landing Pages, Google Ads.
- Responsive-first layout, glassmorphism utilities and components already set up.
- Logo included (copied from the project upload).

Quick local setup
-----------------
1. Unzip the project and open the folder in a terminal.
2. Run `npm install`
3. Run `npm run dev`
4. Open http://localhost:5173

Preparing for Wix embedding
---------------------------
Option A — Host on Vercel and embed:
1. Push this repo to GitHub.
2. Import the repository on Vercel and deploy (Vercel will give you a production URL).
3. In your Wix editor, use an HTML iframe/embed element to embed the Vercel production URL.

Option B — Export a static build and upload:
1. Run `npm run build` to create a `dist` folder.
2. Host the `dist` output on a static host (Netlify, Vercel, S3). Wix doesn't host full React apps directly — embedding via iframe is the recommended approach.

Notes & verification checklist (what I triple-checked)
------------------------------------------------------
- React Router v6 usage and nested routes structure for the SEO and Content pages.
- Tailwind directives and `tailwind.config.cjs` content paths are set to cover all src files.
- All imports use relative paths and asset uses a safe filename (`src/assets/logo.png`).
- No external network calls are required to run locally (besides npm during install).
- Project uses modern Vite config with React plugin.

Next steps I can do for you (choose any):
- Replace dummy content with your real copy (you can paste it and I’ll populate pages).
- Create high-fidelity mockups for all pages (desktop + mobile) and export PNGs.
- Deploy to Vercel for you (I can provide exact steps; I cannot deploy from here).
- Convert to a static HTML-only version (if you prefer to avoid embedding React in Wix).
